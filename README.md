This is a course project I completed in 2022, that our team built an APP that match use-clothes owner and allow them to exchange their needs. 
This is a full-stack dev project which we applied Agile method with multiple API calls like GoogleMap. 
The APP is available both in web and mobile devices.
Direct to Cloth_Matcher directory to see how to run the APP.
